# Candy Popularity Analysis
This project explores the popularity of various candies using the winpercent metric from a dataset of head-to-head candy rankings. By analyzing features such as sugar content, chocolate presence, and other attributes, we aim to uncover what makes a candy more likely to be preferred. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visual insights to highlight trends in candy preferences.
